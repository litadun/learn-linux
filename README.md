# learn-linux

This repository documents my learning and practice of Linux, Git, and
research-oriented software workflows.

The goal is to build solid, reproducible, and professional foundations
for PhD-level scientific computing and research projects.

## Structure

- `src/` – source code and scripts
- `experiments/` – experiments, trials, and reproducible runs
- `notes/` – learning notes and research logs
